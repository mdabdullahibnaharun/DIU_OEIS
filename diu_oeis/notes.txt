1. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment. In your project's root directory, run the following command:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Check if Django is installed in your virtual environment. Run the following command to verify:
   ```
   pip list
   ```

   Look for Django in the list of installed packages. If it is not present, you can install it by running:
   ```
   pip install django
   ```

3. Once Django is installed, try running your Django project again:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This should start the Django development server and your project should run without the "No module named 'django'" error.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your Django project in VS Code with the necessary dependencies installed.
