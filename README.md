## 4. Logical Data Model

The **Logical Data Model (LDM)**, or **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, represents data items, their properties, and relationships. For the **DIUOEIS** project, the LDM serves as the foundation for the **MySQL database**, illustrating entities like:

- Users
- Clubs
- Events
- News
- Notices

This model captures relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, enabling functionalities like:

- Club executives managing multiple clubs.
- Users participating in various events.

## 6. Implementation and Testing

### 6.1 Database Implementation

The **DIUOEIS** project uses **XAMPP** as the database management system with **MySQL** to manage user data efficiently. MySQL was chosen due to its speed, reliability, and user-friendly nature.

### 6.2 Front-end Design

The **front-end** is user-friendly, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap 4** to ensure a responsive and modern interface. Key pages include:

- **Home Page**: Provides easy navigation to clubs, events, news, and notices.
- **Login Page**: Secure login access for users, admins, and club executives.
- **Registration Page**: Allows users to register as club executives.

### 6.3 Back-end Design

The **back-end** is built using **Django**, ensuring secure user authentication and efficient data management. Key features include:

- Strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, Session-based).
- A scalable architecture that allows easy future enhancements.

### 6.4 Testing

A comprehensive **testing process** was conducted, including:

- **Functional Testing**: To ensure that all features work as intended.
- **Usability Testing**: To ensure the interface is user-friendly.
- **Security Testing**: To ensure the platform is secure and data is protected.

Both **manual and automated testing** were performed to verify the applicationâ€™s performance and usability.
